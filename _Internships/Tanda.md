## Description
Brisbane’s fastest growing start-up company is now taking
applications for our 2016/17 Summer Internship.

This is a great opportunity to see what it’s like to work at a
fast growing company that does everything differently. You’ll be
working in our Brisbane office, building and launching a product.

To do this you’ll collecting feedback from thousands of
customers and tens of thousands of users, then throw in a
sprinkle of your best judgement and the advice of the rest of
our team to build a whole new product from scratch. Once it’s
built you’ll be launching it and using customer feedback to
iterate on it, shipping improvements daily.
